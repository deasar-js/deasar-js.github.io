                I have developed a keen interest in software over the years and
                have always been an early adopter of new technology. It was
                within the past 4 years or so that I began tinkering with
                templates, content management systems and components to create
                basic platforms that would emulate the most popular sites people
                use. I graduated Northcoders' full stack JavaScript programme
                early April 2022 and currently I am learning new
                frameworks/libraries.

                Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:

              <Col className="text-center">
                <Image
                  src={selfie}
                  rounded
                  height="200"
                  width="auto"
