                I have developed a keen interest in software over the years and
                have always been an early adopter of new technology. It was
                within the past 4 years or so that I began tinkering with
                templates, content management systems and components to create
                basic platforms that would emulate the most popular sites people
                use. I graduated Northcoders' full stack JavaScript course early
                April 2022 and currently I am learning new frameworks/libraries.
